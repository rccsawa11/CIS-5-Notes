WHY PROGRAM?
-There are many applications to using technology backed by programming from business to home life
-PROGRAM: a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task
-SOFTWARE: a common refrence for programs. Software is very essential to computers
-Programmer/Software Developer = person who designs creates and tests computer programs

A WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM AND A PRESENTATION
-comp sci is an art and a science at the same time
-Things that must be designed for any real world computer program:
*The logic flow of the instructions //like a README?
*The mathematical procedures 
*The appearence of the screens 
*The way information is presented to the user //user interface possibly?
*The program's "user-friendliness" //like how easy it is to use
*Manuals and other forms of written documentation //like a flowchart|pseucode?
-Think of cars for example: cars and programs should be functional, efficent, powerful, easy to use, and pleaseing to look at. 

-Programmers learn languages like C++ because it has very strict rules the computer follows. 
//personal input: This just goes back to source code and machine/object code. 
//Source code was created as a middle man to bring human and computer function to meet because of how specific and strict machine code is.
