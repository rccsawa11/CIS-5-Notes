COMPUTER SYSTEMS: Hardware and Software

Lesson concept
-All computers have similar hardware devices and software components. 
-An overview of standard computer hardware and software orginization.

HARDWARE
-Hardware: the physical parts a computer is made from
-A computer is not an individual device but rather a system of devices
-A typical computer system consists of the major components:
*The central processing unit (CPU)
*Main Memory
*Input devices
*Output devices

THE CPU
-When a computer is performing the tasks a program told it to- 
say that the computer is running/executing the program. 
-The CPU is the part of the computer running the programs 
-It is the most important component in a computer
-CPUs are small chips known as microprocessors
-Its job is to fetch instructions, follow them, and give a result.
-It consists of 2 components: the control unit and the arithmetic (and) logic unit: ALU
-In the ALU the control unit determins where to get the next instuctions and the control signals
-The arthmatic and logic unit performs mathematica operations
-CPU has a cycle when running a program: fetch/decode/execute cycle.
*Fetch: control unit gets the insturctions from memory
*Decode: instructions control unit gets are in numbers, control unit deciphers and produces electronic signal
*Execute: signal is sent to the right prt of the computer to perform task
